# Open Privacy API

We have built a Collaboration to develop Global Privacy Protection standards through tools that can be accessible across all jurisdictions. We are reaching out to the Privacy Community to join our Privacy Collaboration for the purpose of (a) understanding user needs for the protection of privacy, (b) promoting equal access to PII technology, and (c) empowering communities to protect their own privacy. If you are a privacy community advocate, technologist, compliance or policy professional, then we need your help.
